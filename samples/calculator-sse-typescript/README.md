# 🧮 Calculator (SSE Version) - TypeScript

This is a demo Node.js + TypeScript MCP SDK using [Model Context Protocol SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@modelcontextprotocol/sdk). It exposes simple calculation tools like BMI and addition through MCP, and supports real-time responses via Server-Sent Events (SSE).
Explore the MCP architecture and best practices using the [MCP Architecture](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/architecture) and SSE transport.

This MCP Server has multiple tools available:

calculate-bmi | Calculates your BMI based on weight in kg and height in m
calculate-sum | Calculated the sum of two input numbers (a an b)

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

- Visual Studio Code ([link](https://code.visualstudio.com/download))
- Node v22 (ideally installed via [nvm for Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows))

## 🚀 Minimal path to awesome

1. Clone this repository by running `git clone https://github.com/microsoft/copilot-studio-mcp/` in your terminal
1. Open Visual Studio Code on the subfolder `samples/calculator-sse-typescript`
1. Open the terminal and navigate to the same folder
1. Run `npm install`

### Using MCP Server Action in Copilot Studio

#### Steps to Access the MCP Server Action

1. **Open Copilot Studio**  
   Navigate to your [Copilot Studio](https://copilotstudio.microsoft.com) workspace.

2. **Go to Actions**  
   Click on the **Action** menu in the left sidebar.

3. **Select "Custom connector"**  
   Under the Action menu, choose **Custom connector**.

4. **Locate the MCP Server Action**  
   The system will automatically display available tools. Select the **MCP Server Action** from the list.

   ![Custom Connector Selection](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ee74ce02-a1f1-4835-a0a9-9b26ab0f7367)

5. **MCP Server Action Preview**  
   You will be able to view the details of the selected MCP Server Action as shown below:

   ![MCP Server Action](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2992d2b3-af6e-4d61-a0d5-96ae3ba60fe1)

## 📌 Considerations

- ✅ The `/sse` endpoint should **return the full URI** (including protocol and host) when initializing the **MCP transport**. This ensures compatibility when deploying across environments (e.g., localhost vs Azure). It establishes a live connection for streaming MCP interactions.

  **Example:**

  ```ts
  const protocol = req.protocol;
  const host = req.get('host');
  const fullUri = `${protocol}://${host}/mcp`;

### 🔄 Return / Server-Sent Events (SSE) with Full URI

Ensure your custom connector supports **SSE (Server-Sent Events)** and returns the **full URI** as shown:
![Return SSE with Full URI](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1da61513-ea89-4c48-8bf8-096a26ed3e69)

### 🏷️ Add Tags to Your Custom Connector
```yaml
tags:
  - Agentic
  - McpSse
```
### ⚠️ Naming Guidance
Do **not** use `"InvokeMCP"` as your `operationId`.  
Choose a more specific and descriptive name to reflect the purpose of the action and avoid conflicts.

## ☁️ Deploy to Azure (Optional)

Create an Azure App Service (Node.js 18+)
Set the startup command (if needed):

```bash
npm run build && npm run start
```

### SSE Deployment Update

The SSE deployment to Azure with the **West US 2** region using the **Basic plan** was successful and tested without issues.  


## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### ✅ How to Check if Your SSE Server is Running Properly

Follow these steps to verify that your SSE (Server-Sent Events) server is functioning correctly:

---

### 🔍 Step 1: Browse the SSE Endpoint

- Open your browser and navigate to:  
  - `http://localhost:3000/sse` (if running locally), or  
  - Your deployed **Azure URL**.

- Open **Developer Tools** → **Network** tab.

- Look for an **EventStream** connection.

- Under the `Event` section, you should see:
  - **Endpoint**: SSE endpoint
  - **Data**: Your Full URI endpoint

![SSE Browser Network Trace](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/680c6f25-ebba-4494-83d2-2244ad3fb98e)

---

### 🧪 Step 2: Test SSE Endpoint via Postman

1. Copy the **Full URI** (from the EventStream `data`).
2. Use Postman to send a `POST` request to that URI.

**Example URL**:
```
http://calculatormcp-dummyurl.azurewebsites.net/mcpfy/v1/calculatordemo?sessionId=620c84e1-81e2-484d-8737-a7fbc93165b1
```

**Example Request Payload**:
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "2",
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "calculate-bmi",
    "arguments": {
      "weightKg": 180,
      "heightM": 1.8
    }
  }
}
```

If successful, you'll receive a response with a `"message"` confirming that the server is working correctly.
